# Fun code tidbits

Sometimes, even doing silly things can be educational.
For example, the International Obfuscated C Coding Contest has for years been a way to showcase
some of the most devastatingly bad code imaginable. Code that is almost impossible to read
(on purpose), code which does the simplest thing in the most complicated way.

Here you have my favorite from one of the champions of the competition for many years.
First display westley.cc, it's pretty impressive.
Compile and run with the following (remove .out for windows, just type a)

```bash
gcc westley.cc
./a.out 40 -74
```

Then there is the emoji program. It only works in C++20.
