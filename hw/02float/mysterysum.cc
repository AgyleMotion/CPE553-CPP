int main() {
	/*
		Write a program to compute the following sum using single precision (float)
		Note that in general it is not a good idea (Kruger's rule, never use float)
		you are doing this to see
		the error more easily and quickly than with double precision.

		     1     1     1     1
    s = --- + --- + --- + --- + ... going to infinity
        1*1   2*2   3*3   4*4
		Since your computer isn't infinitely fast, you will have to figure out
		where to stop.

		Printing out this sum will yield a number around 1.64 which is not too
		meaningful. Instead, print sqrt(s*6) and you should see something you
		recognize.

		Calculate the series forward and backward. One direction should
		yield much more accuracy than the other. Can you get the answer to a full 7
		digits?
