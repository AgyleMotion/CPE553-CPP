1. Make relies on time on all platforms where code is built. Time must be synchronized if using multiple computers.
2. It takes a lot of work to create a complicated makefile,
   and it changes every time you change the structure of the program.
3. make is a bit slow
   Example: google chrome = 300,000 files, 30Gb. It might take 1 hour to build
   A developer on chrome noticed that just to determine that nothing had to be done, it took 10 seconds
   this developer at Google wrote Ninja (a high speed build system) to solve this problem
4. cmake is a tool to automate building
   it can be configured to use makefiles
   it can be configured to use ninja
