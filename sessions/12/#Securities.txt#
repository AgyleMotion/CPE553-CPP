A security is a financial instrument.
These are typically traded on a market.  Because there is a market, it is relatively easy to buy and sell.  This helps when people need to raise money.

All securities have a price.  This is what the owner is willing to sell for, and what a buyer is willing to pay.  In reality, the situation is a bit more complicated, with a bid price and ask price, but we will ignore this.

Some securities pay the owner. For example, a share of stock is partial ownership of a public company.  Some stocks pay a quarterly dividend.

Another kind of security is a bond.  Bonds are loans.  The borrower pays the bondholder, the coupon is the rate of interest.
