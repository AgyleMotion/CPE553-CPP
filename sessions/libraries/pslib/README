This is a graphing tool that I wrote while working on my robotics thesis.
The cool features are the tight integration with Postscript, and the absolutely crystal clear graphs produced.
It's also very convenient to plot stuff in batch, with a simple config file for each plot.
An interactive tool would be nice, but is not a priority.

In order to build the demo, you need MySQL++, or to do some surgery to the code. That's what I get for doing this for my buddy Dave, who wanted to actually use it to make plots for NYHOPS.  So I created a quick second version without the cool graphs that are so tied to the database.

To build the database version, which uses a nice package available at: http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/
just make

To build the standalone version:
make testGraph2dnodb

run and redirect to a file, which you then send to a postscript printer, or ghostscript.  I only ever tested this thing on our printer, a Docucolor 242, with an incredibly finicky engine called "fiery" and ghostscript.

There's one known bug, some dangling memory that I haven't tracked down.

If you make any cool modifications, let me know:
