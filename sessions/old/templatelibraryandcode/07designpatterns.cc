	#0 list
	   Imagine 28 years ago, Smalltalk on a Sun Sparc II, 8Mb RAM
     80k lists 

		 average size of lists?
		 many lists size = 0
		 many lists size = 1

  #1 design pattern: iterator
	    traverse trhough a complex data structure
			start at the beginning, next, determine whether the end is here
			encapsulation: the user who is moving through the data structure
			should not know anything about it.
